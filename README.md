### Hello World ðŸ‘‹
## My name is Jennifer. I am at the beginning of my learning journey with full-stack development. I really love putting to use what I've learned so far. I still have a long way to go but I am very eager to learn and it is so much fun seeing how everything comes together. I can't wait to continue to learn and grow as a developer!
